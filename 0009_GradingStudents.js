// 0009_GradingStudents.js
// HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

// Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
// Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
// Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

// If the difference between the  and the next multiple of  is less than , round  up to the next multiple of 5.
// If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
// For example, grade =84 will be rounded to 85 but grade =29 will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than 40.

// Given the initial value of  for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process. For each grade-x, round it according to the rules above and print the result on a new line.

// Input Format

// The first line contains a single integer denoting n (the number of students).
// Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a single integer, grade-x, denoting student i's grade.

// Constraints
// 1 <= n <= 60
// 0 <= grade-x <= 100
// Output Format

// For each  of the  grades, print the rounded grade on a new line.

// Sample Input 0

// 4
// 73
// 67
// 38
// 33
// Sample Output 0

// 75
// 67
// 40
// 33

  // grades = [ 73, 67, 38, 33 ];

        var newGrade = (Math.round(grades[i] / 5) * 5);
        if(grades[i]>=38 && newGrade > grades[i]){
            grades[i] = newGrade;
